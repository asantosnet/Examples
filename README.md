# Examples


Some examples of matlab code is shown here. Most of these functions will probalby not work on their own. 

For an example of a working program, ask me personnally, as I would need to send you some excel files ( for Nanoindentation and for a stalled project on the "Ongoing-Stalled-Projects-" repertory) or some matlab functions ( for the Finite Element method programs). THe programs in the quantum engineering repertory should work on their own.
